M525-526 Statistics Code
The code in this repository are solutions I created for M525 and M526 at UTK for the 2022-23 school year.
These problems are either worked examples or excersises from the following textbook:
Pressé S, Sgouralis I. Data Modeling for the Sciences: Applications, Basics, Computations. Cambridge University Press; 2023.
I would like to thank Dr. Ioannis Sgouralis for allowing me to post my solutions here.
There is no guarantee implied or otherwise that my solutions are correct, or my code is functioning.
